# Hyperspectral Analysis - PCA

This repository contains tools and scripts for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on hyperspectral data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB with App Designer
- Hyperspectral data in an appropriate format (csv file)

### Instructions

1. Run **PCA_imaging.mlapp** in App Designer to open the initial window.
2. Press the button **Load** to upload the spectral hypercube.

### Usage

The application allows users to load hyperspectral data and perform PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data for further analysis.

### App Windows

Below are some application windows labeled to guide you:

## Extra

To use the MATLAB scripts provided in this repository, your hyperspectral data should be in the following format:

1. **File Format**: The data should be stored in CSV format.
2. **Data Structure**:
    - Each row represents a different sample.
    - Each column represents the intensity value at a specific wavelength.
3. **Required Metadata**:
    - Sample ID: A unique identifier for each sample.
    - Acquisition Date: The date when the sample was acquired.
4. **Example Data Entry**:
    ```csv
    SampleID, AcquisitionDate, Wavelength1, Wavelength2, ..., WavelengthN
    S001, 2025-03-11, 0.123, 0.456, ..., 0.789
    S002, 2025-03-12, 0.321, 0.654, ..., 0.987
    ```
5. **Preprocessing Steps**:
    - Ensure all intensity values are normalized between 0 and 1.
    - Remove any rows with missing or corrupted data.
